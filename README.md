## BaronessLib - easy Bukkit library.

It allows you to save time by eliminating monotonous work and make the code cleaner.

You can use it freely and offer your ideas: `https://vk.com/black_baroness`

## How to use?

This library is works as a plugin that does not create any load on the server.

1. Download the release or build .jar file by yourself.
2. Add .jar file to your project's library.
3. Add this file to the /plugins directory.
4. You can add a plugin to `Depend`, but I personally worked without it.

## What features does the library have?

The features are constantly expanding, so I strongly recommend just looking at the source code. 

Each class and method has JavaDocs with a detailed description, so there should be no problems.

## I wish you clean code!
